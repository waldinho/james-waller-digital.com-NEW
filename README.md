Yet to come up with an idea for this but this is the framework started.

To do:

1. Loading spinner
2. Navigation
3. Find cool picture for the homepage, perhaps do random image generator.
4. Decide on colours.
5. Set up JSON file for content.
6. Fonts and typography CSS.
7. Good morning, afternoon, evening on homepage logic.
