To do:

1. Styling for re-usable components (grid and title/text).
2. Add content.
3. Remember to add stuff in from AKQA (Bunnings, Homebase, etc).
4. Link up CV (Use radar example from here for skills - http://jerairrest.github.io/react-chartjs-2/)
5. Add Job title and skills used for each portfolio company on hover.
6. Responsive stuff (use seperate mobile stylesheet)
